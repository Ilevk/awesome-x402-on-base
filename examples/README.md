# Examples

## 📝 TL;DR

**What**: Base chain-specific x402 examples and advanced use cases
**Official Examples**: Use [`external/x402/examples/python`](../external/x402/examples/python) (via submodule)
**This Directory**: Base optimizations, AI agents, production patterns (coming soon)
**Korean Guides**: Available in [`docs/korean/examples/`](../docs/korean/examples/)

---

This directory contains **Base-specific** examples and advanced use cases that complement the official x402 examples.

## Directory Structure

```
examples/
└── base-specific/      # Base chain optimized examples
    ├── quickstart/     # Quick start examples for Base
    ├── ai-agents/      # AI agent integration (coming soon)
    └── advanced/       # Advanced optimizations (coming soon)
```

## What's Different from Official Examples?

The [official x402 examples](../external/x402/examples/python) already use Base chain by default. This directory provides:

1. **Base-Specific Optimizations**
   - Gas optimization techniques for Base
   - USDC integration patterns
   - Base Sepolia testnet configurations

2. **Advanced Use Cases**
   - AI agent autonomous payments
   - API monetization strategies
   - Production deployment examples

3. **Community Contributions**
   - Real-world implementations
   - Best practices from the community
   - Hackathon projects

## Official Examples

For standard x402 implementations, refer to:
- [Official Python Examples](../external/x402/examples/python) (via submodule)
- [Korean Guides for Official Examples](../docs/korean/examples/)
